## Abstract
<p align="justify"> 
Temporary pools are ephemeral aquatic habitats characterized by fluctuating water levels and high environmental variability. Despite their transient nature, these ecosystems support diverse fish communities and play crucial ecological roles in maintaining local biodiversity. However, they face increasing threats from anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, pollution, and habitat degradation. This systematic review, spanning 1981 to 2023, analyses 111 peer-reviewed articles to uncover global research trends and gaps concerning fish inhabiting temporary pools. The analysis reveals an increase in publications after 2010, what could be reflecting growing scientific interest. While freshwater pools dominated the research, there was a notable lack of studies on marine tide pools and artificial habitats. Geographically, research was concentrated in South America and Africa, particularly in Brazil. Reproduction and taxonomy were the most common themes, with the focus primarily on Rivulidae and Nothobranchiidae. Notably, 61 species of Rivulidae and 10 of Nothobranchiidae were studied, while other 162 species, mainly addressed through community-level studies, received limited attention. Despite this, significant knowledge gaps persist in areas such as ecotoxicology, physiology, trophic ecology, and behavior. Our findings emphasize the need for more comprehensive research to inform effective conservation strategies, particularly in underrepresented areas. A broader focus on other fish clades and ecological aspects will be critical for protecting the biodiversity and ecological integrity of these vulnerable ecosystems.
